# CSCI-5448-OOD-Project-Mocks-And-Stubs

Testing in Object-Oriented (OO) systems introduces dis-
tinct challenges due to features such as inheritance, en-
capsulation, and polymorphism. While these concepts
enhance modularity and reusability, they often compli-
cate component isolation during testing.
This project investigates how mocking and stubbing can
simplify testing in OO contexts. The goal is to im-
prove testability, maintainability, and isolation through
the strategic use of test doubles. The study will illustrate
these ideas using Java examples and demonstrate how de-
sign quality directly affects testing effectiveness.
